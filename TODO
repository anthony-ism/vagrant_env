Apache Conf* 
  just changed AllowOverride line
  and documentroot, and directory line to include html
  -- ie
  
  DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"
  <Directory "/var/www/html">
     Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
     AllowOverride All
     Require all granted
   </Directory>

Vagrantfile config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/var/www" [DONE 5/29/14]
------
Apache overwrites /var/www/html/index.html
----------
Possibly: since hostname is set to unknown address, reverse dns lookup doesn't work 
  Maybe only machines in the cloud get the following vagrant line   webserver.vm.hostname = "devweb01.ismfast.com"
